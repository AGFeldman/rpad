I found out about python curses library while looking into this

set conceallevel=1
set concealcursor=nvic
hi clear Conceal
syntax match Entity /\S/ conceal cchar=*

emphasis: focus on the common case

entries are individual files. This makes isolation / consistency possible. These files are immutable once written. Use vim -M to open a file in read-only.

necessary files are written in an encfs directory.

have several different scripts. no hotkeys: just run the scripts on a path, or cd to the directory.

add_entry_visible:
add_entry_invisible:
    use vim to have text appear on screen, but non-whitespace characters are masked.
open_running_pad: (if host is not fire, then this is opened read-only)
    if host is fire:
        assemble, open, commit any changes
    if host is not fire:
        assemble a *guess*, open read-only, trash the guess
        (in fact, this can be a separate script, "open_guess")

the running_pad document itself is version controlled, in a git repo. fire periodically, automatically merges entries into it, and then moves the entries to a "DONE" folder. additionally, the running_pad can be edited by open_running_pad, if run on fire.

in fact, scripts could chmod files before and after working with them, so the files are read-only except when then need to support writes.

could even try to record location by doing stuff like http://stackoverflow.com/questions/24906833/get-your-location-through-python

the file names for the entries should be unix-time-milliseconds_random-string

could also log when i just view the file

should protect the encfs thing with a strong password, and keep the directory unlocked most of the time

alais rs to entry_show
alias rh to entry_hide

i should pay attention to usage details. like, with the current system, i often look away while typing in hidden mode, and i guess i sometimes have positive feelings about that.

setup:
encfs /d/.rpad_enc /home/aaron/rpad_dec
# use with `fusermount -u ~/rpad_dec`
mkdir /home/aaron/rpad_dec/entries
in ~/.bash_aliases:
alias rs="python /d/Coding/rpad/entry_show.py"
alias rh="python /d/Coding/rpad/entry_hide.py"

after running the script, it could tell you how long you spent writing. heck, it could give you stats from, say, the last week.
